NoteIt
======

NoteIt is a program written in Haskell to easily create edit and list your
small notes. The purpose is to have all your small notes organized in a single
place, with easy editing.

For now this is just an alpha version, testing how it works for my use cases.

Usage
-----

The program has three flags for adding, listing and editing.

`--add` Add a new file
`--list` List files
`--edit NUM` Edit the file numbered
